Do you need some financial help getting to useR! 2018? If so, apply for a scholarship. We have funding to provide a few scholarships already, and still hoping for getting more funding to award more. In addition R Ladies Melbourne are offering two $500 travel scholarships! Decisions on scholarships will be based on potential positive impact on the community of the applicant&amp;rsquo;s participation, encouraging diversity to balance participant demographics for a supportive environment, economic need, and available funds for scholarships.</description>
