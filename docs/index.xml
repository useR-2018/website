      <description>This interview took place at the rStudio::conf in San Diego, in January, 2018. Some things cannot be translated from audio to text - and one thing that was hard to fully capture is Thomas’s upbeat, friendly, and positive attitude about just about everything.
Nick: What is your name and occupation, and where do you live?
Thomas: My name is Thomas Lin Pedersen. I live in Denmark, and am currently working at SKAT, the Danish taxation authority, where I’m developing tools for our other data scientists.</description>

      <description>useR! is the main annual meeting of the R community, and has been growing in attendance along with the language. This is the first time that the conference will be held outside Europe and the USA, and it will be an opportunity for a new cohort of the R community to come along, improve their skills and make connections across Australiasia and beyond.
Sponsorship of useR! 2018 is an opportunity to visibly support the R community, to reach a large group of highly skilled data science professionals, support your organisation&amp;rsquo;s analytics or data science pipeline and to help make the conference a success.</description>
