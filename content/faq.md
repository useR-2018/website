> Changing registration details

It should possible to login and change registration details, like add/remove tutorials or add/remove child care or t-shirt size. It you have trouble email the organisers at buseco-user2018@monash.edu.

The child care rate is less than half the market rate, partially due to sponsorship from EMS. We have reserved an extra room in the BCEC for child care. There is also a nearby park where the providers may take the children during the day.
